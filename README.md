# DConf to Nix

This is a project to convert dconf to nix script.

It doesn't work yet, but it hopefully will soon. It's not a complete solution, but it's a start.
In the repo is a dconf.settings file, which is the settings I am trying to convert.

Feel free to make it better, and even better if you can make it work universally!

Feel free to fork and submit pull requests!
